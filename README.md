# Hi, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering student at McMaster University, passionate about the integration of diverse engineering principles into cohesive solutions. My interests span across various domains including artificial intelligence, robotics, embedded systems, and data analytics. Through numerous projects, I've had the opportunity to delve into these areas, engineering technology to solve real-world problems and pursue innovative solutions.

## ðŸŒŸ Projects

### [IceAnalytics](https://iceanalytics.ca)
_Repo: [github.com/andrewderango/IceAnalytics](https://github.com/andrewderango/IceAnalytics)_

Analytics platform delivering real-time probabilistic projections and novel insights into games, players, and teams in professional hockey. Powered by a cutting-edge bootstrapped Monte Carlo ensemble projection engine, the framework leverages innovative models and algorithms to deliver unparalleled analytics on player impact, team performance, and game outcomes.

_Tech Stack: ReactJS, Python, Firebase, Supabase, PostgreSQL, XGBoost, neural networks, deep learning, NHL API._

### HeartFlow
_Repo: [github.com/andrewderango/HeartFlow](https://github.com/andrewderango/HeartFlow)_

Advanced pacemaker system designed to deliver precise cardiac pacing and monitoring capabilities. It includes firmware for an FRDM-K64F microcontroller to operate pacing behaviour and interact with the emulated heart, and a robust Electron desktop application to control the pacemaker firmware and visualize telemetry data. The firmware and desktop application communicate with each other bidirectionally via serial communication using a custom UART protocol.

_Tech Stack: ReactJS, Electron, Simulink, Python, UART, Node.js, FRDM-K64F._

### Neural Network in C
_Repo: [github.com/andrewderango/Neural-Network-in-C](https://github.com/andrewderango/https://github.com/andrewderango/Neural-Network-in-C)_

Developed a full neural network entirely from scratch in C with customizable architecture and hyperparameters. Established a robust framework that enables users to visualize the model's performance and accuracy in real-time, and seamlessly construct, train, export, and deploy ANNs tailored to their own datasets.

_Tech Stack: C, neural networks, deep learning._

### HELIOS: High-resolution Earth Light and Infrared Observation System

_Repo: [https://github.com/andrewderango/helios-nasa](https://github.com/andrewderango/helios-nasa)_

Web-based application that won the 2024 NASA Space Apps Hackthon in Hamilton. The application projects the orbital trajectories of the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites to predict future passover dates of a user-specified location. Upon satellite passover, the application interacts with NASA's AppEARS API to pull surface reflectance (SR) data from three different wavelength bands and automatically sends the user the corresponding SR data.

_Tech Stack: Next.js, Node.js, Firebase, Python._
